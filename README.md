# USING THE REACTO METHOD TO SOLVE PROBLEMS
## 1. Repeat. 
-   **DO NOT** start to solve the question right away! **REPAT** the question to ensure that you do understand the problem. It takes time but take your time to understand the problem. At this point you are encouraged to create some **example inputs** and what the **expected output** would be.
## 2. Examples. 
-   Encourage yourself to create some example inputs and what the expected output would be

## 3. Approach. 
-   Plan and Communicate your appach to the problem. There is no coing involved at the moment but just to thinking out and articulating what you will planning to do next.

## 4. Code
-   Start coding out the solution. Trying as best as you can to following your apprach from step #4. Write down your actual code or pseudo code to solve the problem

## 5. Test
-   After done with write down you code (actual or pseudo), testing your code. Using the examples you wrote from #2 run each example through your code(make sure you are **running it through the code you actually wrote, not what you think you wrote**) and check if you get the **expected** output.

## 6. Optimize.
-   Final step to optimize your code. Once you have found out a working solution, you can go back and optimize it - Refactor the code. Improve the time and/or space complexity. Also do anything else that will improve your code. 

These are the REACTO method way to solve any problems. Take your time to do the first step. The first step is always the hardest but the most important step in our life. Once you are used to this method, you can solve any algorithms or life problem.

Happy coding!
cheers.
